The bill increases school district transparency and accountability for selecting and using instructional materials and library materials by requiring that district school boards be responsible for the contents of classroom libraries, in addition to instructional materials and school libraries. As part of fulfilling this responsibility, the bill requires that district school board policies regarding objections to specific materials include objection on the basis that the material depicts or describes sexual conduct, as defined in law. The bill provides for an exception to this objection for material used in required instruction on HIV/AIDS, child sexual abuse prevention, or any other course identified by the DOE. Any specific materials subject to an objection on the basis that the materials are pornographic, harmful to minors, or describe or depict sexual conduct must be removed from circulation at the school where the objection was made, within 5 days of the objection, until the completion of the objection process. Committees convened by a school district to review and make recommendations related to the adoption of instructional materials must include parents of students that will have access to the materials being reviewed. All meetings of such committees must be publicly noticed and open to the public. The bill creates an appeals process for a parent that disagrees with the school board’s determination on his or her objection. The DOE must adopt an objection form for use by school districts. The bill requires that all books in elementary school classroom libraries be included in the required online catalogue of elementary school library materials and school districts must adopt and implement a process for parents to limit their child’s access to library materials. The bill revises the annual reporting requirements regarding objections to materials. The bill requires the DOE to annually approve all instructional materials used to teach reproductive health and any disease, including HIV/AIDS. The bill defines “sex” for the purposes of the education code and requires that instruction in human sexuality include instruction on the binary, stable, and unchanging nature of biological sex. The bill expands existing parental authority over a child’s education by extending the existing prohibition on inst ruction relating to sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through grade 3 to include prekindergarten through grade 8 and expressly stating that charter schools must comply with this requirement. Consistent with existing law, the bill requires that instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in grades 9 through 12 be age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students. Additionally, the bill requires additional transparency regarding school district policies and procedures. The bill implements new requirements relating to the use of personal titles and pronouns in Florida’s public schools, with an exception for individuals with specified conditions. The bill prohibits an employee, contractor, or student, as a condition of employment, enrollment, or participation, at a public K-12 educational institution, be required to refer to another individual by a personal title or pronouns that do not align with the person’s sex. Similarly, a K -12 public institution employee or contractor may not provide a student with the individuals preferred personal title or pronouns if they do not correspond to the employee or contactor’s sex.

The bill increases school district transparency and accountability for selecting and using instructional materials and library materials by requiring that district school boards be responsible for the contents of classroom libraries, in addition to instructional materials and school libraries. As part of fulfilling this responsibility, the bill requires that district school board policies regarding objections to specific materials include objection on the basis that the material depicts or describes sexual conduct, as defined in law. The bill provides for an exception to this objection for material used in required instruction on HIV/AIDS, child sexual abuse prevention, or any other course identified by the DOE. Any specific materials subject to an objection on the basis that the materials are pornographic, harmful to minors, or describe or depict sexual conduct must be removed from circulation at the school where the objection was made, within 5 days of the objection, until the completion of the objection process. Committees convened by a school district to review and make recommendations related to the adoption of instructional materials must include parents of students that will have access to the materials being reviewed. All meetings of such committees must be publicly noticed and open to the public. The bill creates an appeals process for a parent that disagrees with the school board’s determination on his or her objection. The DOE must adopt an objection form for use by school districts. The bill requires that all books in elementary school classroom libraries be included in the required online catalogue of elementary school library materials and school districts must adopt and implement a process for parents to limit their child’s access to library materials. The bill revises the annual reporting requirements regarding objections to materials. The bill requires the DOE to annually approve all instructional materials used to teach reproductive health and any disease, including HIV/AIDS. The bill defines “sex” for the purposes of the education code and requires that instruction in human sexuality include instruction on the binary, stable, and unchanging nature of biological sex. The bill expands existing parental authority over a child’s education by extending the existing prohibition on inst ruction relating to sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through grade 3 to include prekindergarten through grade 8 and expressly stating that charter schools must comply with this requirement. Consistent with existing law, the bill requires that instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in grades 9 through 12 be age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students. Additionally, the bill requires additional transparency regarding school district policies and procedures. The bill implements new requirements relating to the use of personal titles and pronouns in Florida’s public schools, with an exception for individuals with specified conditions. The bill prohibits an employee, contractor, or student, as a condition of employment, enrollment, or participation, at a public K-12 educational institution, be required to refer to another individual by a personal title or pronouns that do not align with the person’s sex. Similarly, a K -12 public institution employee or contractor may not provide a student with the individuals preferred personal title or pronouns if they do not correspond to the employee or contactor’s sex. A school may not require a student to provide his or her preferred personal title or pronouns and may not apply any penalty or adverse action against a student for not providing this information.

The Bill requires the board of directors of a school district to notify the DE of any book that is removed from a school library because the book is deemed to contain obscene or sexually explicit material. The DE is required to maintain a list of such books, and school districts are prohibited from allowing a student to access a book on the list unless the school district has received prior written consent from the student’s parent or guardian. The Bill also provides for a number of curriculum changes, mostly to human growth and development curriculum. Specifically, the Bill prohibits any instruction by a school district, charter school, or innovation zone school regarding gender identity or human sexuality before grade five, or grade six if grade six is taught in elementary school. The Bill also removes language relating to certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In addition, the Bill requires students to pass the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services civics test as part of required United States government classes.

The Bill makes an exception for surveys required by State or federal law, but requires schools to provide seven days’ written notice to the student’s parent or guardian before administering such surveys. School districts are also prohibited from releasing information about students without receiving parental consent. The Bill asserts that a parent or guardian bears ultimate responsibility and has the constitutionally protected right to make decisions affecting their minor child, including decisions related to medical care, moral upbringing, religious upbringing, residence, education, and extracurricular activities. This bill requires a school district to notify a student’s parent or guardian if any employee reasonably believes that the student has expressed a gender identity that is different than the biological sex listed on the student’s birth certificate. If the school district is aware of specific threats to student safety that may occur as a result of such a disclosure, the school is not permitted to notify the parents, but is instead required to contact the Department of Health and Human Services. This bill permits the parent or guardian of a student to access and review any school record concerning the parent’s or guardian’s child unless the record is specifically prohibited from being disclosed. This bill prohibits school employees from referring to a student by a name or pronouns that do not correspond to the biological sex listed on the child’s birth certificate without explicit written consent from the student’s parent or guardian. This bill also prohibits school districts from requiring a student to engage in any activity or instruction provided by a guest lecturer or any activity or instruction that involves obscene or sexually explicit material without the explicit written consent of the student’s parent or guardian. Schools are required to provide notice of any such activity or instruction to parents or guardians at least seven days prior to the activity or instruction. Violations of these requirements carry penalties of a written warning for the first violation and a formal review by the Board of Educational Examiners for any subsequent violation.

The Bill requires the board of directors of a school district to notify the DE of any book that is removed from a school library because the book is deemed to contain obscene or sexually explicit material. The DE is required to maintain a list of such books, and school districts are prohibited from allowing a student to access a book on the list unless the school district has received prior written consent from the student’s parent or guardian. The Bill also provides for a number of curriculum changes, mostly to human growth and development curriculum. Specifically, the Bill prohibits any instruction by a school district, charter school, or innovation zone school regarding gender identity or human sexuality before grade five, or grade six if grade six is taught in elementary school. The Bill also removes language relating to certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In addition, the Bill requires students to pass the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services civics test as part of required United States government classes.

The Bill makes an exception for surveys required by State or federal law, but requires schools to provide seven days’ written notice to the student’s parent or guardian before administering such surveys. School districts are also prohibited from releasing information about students without receiving parental consent. The Bill asserts that a parent or guardian bears ultimate responsibility and has the constitutionally protected right to make decisions affecting their minor child, including decisions related to medical care, moral upbringing, religious upbringing, residence, education, and extracurricular activities. This bill requires a school district to notify a student’s parent or guardian if any employee reasonably believes that the student has expressed a gender identity that is different than the biological sex listed on the student’s birth certificate. If the school district is aware of specific threats to student safety that may occur as a result of such a disclosure, the school is not permitted to notify the parents, but is instead required to contact the Department of Health and Human Services. This bill permits the parent or guardian of a student to access and review any school record concerning the parent’s or guardian’s child unless the record is specifically prohibited from being disclosed. This bill prohibits school employees from referring to a student by a name or pronouns that do not correspond to the biological sex listed on the child’s birth certificate without explicit written consent from the student’s parent or guardian. This bill also prohibits school districts from requiring a student to engage in any activity or instruction provided by a guest lecturer or any activity or instruction that involves obscene or sexually explicit material without the explicit written consent of the student’s parent or guardian. Schools are required to provide notice of any such activity or instruction to parents or guardians at least seven days prior to the activity or instruction. Violations of these requirements carry penalties of a written warning for the first violation and a formal review by the Board of Educational Examiners for any subsequent violation. The bill also removes the requirement that students identified as requiring special education who wish to receive private competent instruction receive the permission of the local Area Education Agency (AEAs).

The bill increases school district transparency and accountability for selecting and using instructional materials and library materials by requiring that district school boards be responsible for the contents of classroom libraries, in addition to instructional materials and school libraries. As part of fulfilling this responsibility, the bill requires that district school board policies regarding objections to specific materials include objection on the basis that the material depicts or describes sexual conduct, as defined in law. The bill provides for an exception to this objection for material used in required instruction on HIV/AIDS, child sexual abuse prevention, or any other course identified by the DOE. Any specific materials subject to an objection on the basis that the materials are pornographic, harmful to minors, or describe or depict sexual conduct must be removed from circulation at the school where the objection was made, within 5 days of the objection, until the completion of the objection process. Committees convened by a school district to review and make recommendations related to the adoption of instructional materials must include parents of students that will have access to the materials being reviewed. All meetings of such committees must be publicly noticed and open to the public. The bill creates an appeals process for a parent that disagrees with the school board’s determination on his or her objection. The DOE must adopt an objection form for use by school districts. The bill requires that all books in elementary school classroom libraries be included in the required online catalogue of elementary school library materials and school districts must adopt and implement a process for parents to limit their child’s access to library materials. The bill revises the annual reporting requirements regarding objections to materials. The bill requires the DOE to annually approve all instructional materials used to teach reproductive health and any disease, including HIV/AIDS. The bill defines “sex” for the purposes of the education code and requires that instruction in human sexuality include instruction on the binary, stable, and unchanging nature of biological sex. The bill expands existing parental authority over a child’s education by extending the existing prohibition on inst ruction relating to sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through grade 3 to include prekindergarten through grade 8 and expressly stating that charter schools must comply with this requirement. Consistent with existing law, the bill requires that instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in grades 9 through 12 be age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students. Additionally, the bill requires additional transparency regarding school district policies and procedures. The bill implements new requirements relating to the use of personal titles and pronouns in Florida’s public schools, with an exception for individuals with specified conditions. The bill prohibits an employee, contractor, or student, as a condition of employment, enrollment, or participation, at a public K-12 educational institution, be required to refer to another individual by a personal title or pronouns that do not align with the person’s sex. Similarly, a K -12 public institution employee or contractor may not provide a student with the individuals preferred personal title or pronouns if they do not correspond to the employee or contactor’s sex. A school may not require a student to provide his or her preferred personal title or pronouns and may not apply any penalty or adverse action against a student for not providing this information.

School districts are also prohibited from releasing information about students without receiving parental consent. The Bill asserts that a parent or guardian bears ultimate responsibility and has the constitutionally protected right to make decisions affecting their minor child, including decisions related to medical care, moral upbringing, religious upbringing, residence, education, and extracurricular activities. This bill requires a school district to notify a student’s parent or guardian if any employee reasonably believes that the student has expressed a gender identity that is different than the biological sex listed on the student’s birth certificate. If the school district is aware of specific threats to student safety that may occur as a result of such a disclosure, the school is not permitted to notify the parents, but is instead required to contact the Department of Health and Human Services. This bill permits the parent or guardian of a student to access and review any school record concerning the parent’s or guardian’s child unless the record is specifically prohibited from being disclosed.

Schools are required to provide notice of any such activity or instruction to parents or guardians at least seven days prior to the activity or instruction. Violations of these requirements carry penalties of a written warning for the first violation and a formal review by the Board of Educational Examiners for any subsequent violation.

The bill increases school district transparency and accountability for selecting and using instructional materials and library materials by requiring that district school boards be responsible for the contents of classroom libraries, in addition to instructional materials and school libraries. As part of fulfilling this responsibility, the bill requires that district school board policies regarding objections to specific materials include objection on the basis that the material depicts or describes sexual conduct, as defined in law. The bill provides for an exception to this objection for material used in required instruction on HIV/AIDS, child sexual abuse prevention, or any other course identified by the DOE. Any specific materials subject to an objection on the basis that the materials are pornographic, harmful to minors, or describe or depict sexual conduct must be removed from circulation at the school where the objection was made, within 5 days of the objection, until the completion of the objection process. Committees convened by a school district to review and make recommendations related to the adoption of instructional materials must include parents of students that will have access to the materials being reviewed. All meetings of such committees must be publicly noticed and open to the public. The bill creates an appeals process for a parent that disagrees with the school board’s determination on his or her objection. The DOE must adopt an objection form for use by school districts. The bill requires that all books in elementary school classroom libraries be included in the required online catalogue of elementary school library materials and school districts must adopt and implement a process for parents to limit their child’s access to library materials. The bill revises the annual reporting requirements regarding objections to materials. The bill requires the DOE to annually approve all instructional materials used to teach reproductive health and any disease, including HIV/AIDS. The bill defines “sex” for the purposes of the education code and requires that instruction in human sexuality include instruction on the binary, stable, and unchanging nature of biological sex. The bill expands existing parental authority over a child’s education by extending the existing prohibition on inst ruction relating to sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through grade 3 to include prekindergarten through grade 8 and expressly stating that charter schools must comply with this requirement. Consistent with existing law, the bill requires that instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in grades 9 through 12 be age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students. Additionally, the bill requires additional transparency regarding school district policies and procedures. The bill implements new requirements relating to the use of personal titles and pronouns in Florida’s public schools, with an exception for individuals with specified conditions. The bill prohibits an employee, contractor, or student, as a condition of employment, enrollment, or participation, at a public K-12 educational institution, be required to refer to another individual by a personal title or pronouns that do not align with the person’s sex. Similarly, a K -12 public institution employee or contractor may not provide a student with the individuals preferred personal title or pronouns if they do not correspond to the employee or contactor’s sex. A school may not require a student to provide his or her preferred personal title or pronouns and may not apply any penalty or adverse action against a student for not providing this information.

The Bill also provides for a number of curriculum changes, mostly to human growth and development curriculum. Specifically, the Bill prohibits any instruction by a school district, charter school, or innovation zone school regarding gender identity or human sexuality before grade five, or grade six if grade six is taught in elementary school.

The Bill makes an exception for surveys required by State or federal law, but requires schools to provide seven days’ written notice to the student’s parent or guardian before administering such surveys. School districts are also prohibited from releasing information about students without receiving parental consent. The Bill asserts that a parent or guardian bears ultimate responsibility and has the constitutionally protected right to make decisions affecting their minor child, including decisions related to medical care, moral upbringing, religious upbringing, residence, education, and extracurricular activities. This bill requires a school district to notify a student’s parent or guardian if any employee reasonably believes that the student has expressed a gender identity that is different than the biological sex listed on the student’s birth certificate. If the school district is aware of specific threats to student safety that may occur as a result of such a disclosure, the school is not permitted to notify the parents, but is instead required to contact the Department of Health and Human Services. This bill permits the parent or guardian of a student to access and review any school record concerning the parent’s or guardian’s child unless the record is specifically prohibited from being disclosed. This bill prohibits school employees from referring to a student by a name or pronouns that do not correspond to the biological sex listed on the child’s birth certificate without explicit written consent from the student’s parent or guardian.

Violations of these requirements carry penalties of a written warning for the first violation and a formal review by the Board of Educational Examiners for any subsequent violation. The bill also removes the requirement that students identified as requiring special education who wish to receive private competent instruction receive the permission of the local Area Education Agency (AEAs).

The bill increases school district transparency and accountability for selecting and using instructional materials and library materials by requiring that district school boards be responsible for the contents of classroom libraries, in addition to instructional materials and school libraries. As part of fulfilling this responsibility, the bill requires that district school board policies regarding objections to specific materials include objection on the basis that the material depicts or describes sexual conduct, as defined in law. The bill provides for an exception to this objection for material used in required instruction on HIV/AIDS, child sexual abuse prevention, or any other course identified by the DOE. Any specific materials subject to an objection on the basis that the materials are pornographic, harmful to minors, or describe or depict sexual conduct must be removed from circulation at the school where the objection was made, within 5 days of the objection, until the completion of the objection process. Committees convened by a school district to review and make recommendations related to the adoption of instructional materials must include parents of students that will have access to the materials being reviewed. All meetings of such committees must be publicly noticed and open to the public. The bill creates an appeals process for a parent that disagrees with the school board’s determination on his or her objection. The DOE must adopt an objection form for use by school districts. The bill requires that all books in elementary school classroom libraries be included in the required online catalogue of elementary school library materials and school districts must adopt and implement a process for parents to limit their child’s access to library materials. The bill revises the annual reporting requirements regarding objections to materials. The bill requires the DOE to annually approve all instructional materials used to teach reproductive health and any disease, including HIV/AIDS. The bill defines “sex” for the purposes of the education code and requires that instruction in human sexuality include instruction on the binary, stable, and unchanging nature of biological sex. The bill expands existing parental authority over a child’s education by extending the existing prohibition on inst ruction relating to sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through grade 3 to include prekindergarten through grade 8 and expressly stating that charter schools must comply with this requirement. Consistent with existing law, the bill requires that instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in grades 9 through 12 be age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students. Additionally, the bill requires additional transparency regarding school district policies and procedures. The bill implements new requirements relating to the use of personal titles and pronouns in Florida’s public schools, with an exception for individuals with specified conditions. The bill prohibits an employee, contractor, or student, as a condition of employment, enrollment, or participation, at a public K-12 educational institution, be required to refer to another individual by a personal title or pronouns that do not align with the person’s sex. Similarly, a K -12 public institution employee or contractor may not provide a student with the individuals preferred personal title or pronouns if they do not correspond to the employee or contactor’s sex. A school may not require a student to provide his or her preferred personal title or pronouns and may not apply any penalty or adverse action against a student for not providing this information.

The Bill requires the board of directors of a school district to notify the DE of any book that is removed from a school library because the book is deemed to contain obscene or sexually explicit material. The DE is required to maintain a list of such books, and school districts are prohibited from allowing a student to access a book on the list unless the school district has received prior written consent from the student’s parent or guardian. The Bill also provides for a number of curriculum changes, mostly to human growth and development curriculum. Specifically, the Bill prohibits any instruction by a school district, charter school, or innovation zone school regarding gender identity or human sexuality before grade five, or grade six if grade six is taught in elementary school. The Bill also removes language relating to certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In addition, the Bill requires students to pass the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services civics test as part of required United States government classes.

The Bill makes an exception for surveys required by State or federal law, but requires schools to provide seven days’ written notice to the student’s parent or guardian before administering such surveys. School districts are also prohibited from releasing information about students without receiving parental consent. The Bill asserts that a parent or guardian bears ultimate responsibility and has the constitutionally protected right to make decisions affecting their minor child, including decisions related to medical care, moral upbringing, religious upbringing, residence, education, and extracurricular activities. This bill requires a school district to notify a student’s parent or guardian if any employee reasonably believes that the student has expressed a gender identity that is different than the biological sex listed on the student’s birth certificate. If the school district is aware of specific threats to student safety that may occur as a result of such a disclosure, the school is not permitted to notify the parents, but is instead required to contact the Department of Health and Human Services. This bill permits the parent or guardian of a student to access and review any school record concerning the parent’s or guardian’s child unless the record is specifically prohibited from being disclosed. This bill prohibits school employees from referring to a student by a name or pronouns that do not correspond to the biological sex listed on the child’s birth certificate without explicit written consent from the student’s parent or guardian. This bill also prohibits school districts from requiring a student to engage in any activity or instruction provided by a guest lecturer or any activity or instruction that involves obscene or sexually explicit material without the explicit written consent of the student’s parent or guardian. Schools are required to provide notice of any such activity or instruction to parents or guardians at least seven days prior to the activity or instruction. Violations of these requirements carry penalties of a written warning for the first violation and a formal review by the Board of Educational Examiners for any subsequent violation. The bill also removes the requirement that students identified as requiring special education who wish to receive private competent instruction receive the permission of the local Area Education Agency (AEAs). This bill allows the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of a student identified as requiring special education to request dual enrollment.",IA SF496

If a husband and wife have previously obtained a standard marriage license, they may convert that to a covenant marriage license by submitting a declaration and affidavit, as specified in the act. The husband and wife shall not be required to receive premarital counseling or have the converted covenant marriage solemnized. Additionally, this act establishes the requirements for terminating a covenant marriage. A husband or wife may file a petition in court for legal separation at any time, but a dissolution may only be granted after the court has first ordered a legal separation. The court shall order both parties to attend at least 40 hours of marital counseling prior to ordering a dissolution of marriage. This counseling may be provided by either a faith-based organization or a professional marriage counselor or agency.

The bill increases school district transparency and accountability for selecting and using instructional materials and library materials by requiring that district school boards be responsible for the contents of classroom libraries, in addition to instructional materials and school libraries. As part of fulfilling this responsibility, the bill requires that district school board policies regarding objections to specific materials include objection on the basis that the material depicts or describes sexual conduct, as defined in law. The bill provides for an exception to this objection for material used in required instruction on HIV/AIDS, child sexual abuse prevention, or any other course identified by the DOE. Any specific materials subject to an objection on the basis that the materials are pornographic, harmful to minors, or describe or depict sexual conduct must be removed from circulation at the school where the objection was made, within 5 days of the objection, until the completion of the objection process. Committees convened by a school district to review and make recommendations related to the adoption of instructional materials must include parents of students that will have access to the materials being reviewed. All meetings of such committees must be publicly noticed and open to the public. The bill creates an appeals process for a parent that disagrees with the school board’s determination on his or her objection. The DOE must adopt an objection form for use by school districts. The bill requires that all books in elementary school classroom libraries be included in the required online catalogue of elementary school library materials and school districts must adopt and implement a process for parents to limit their child’s access to library materials. The bill revises the annual reporting requirements regarding objections to materials. The bill requires the DOE to annually approve all instructional materials used to teach reproductive health and any disease, including HIV/AIDS. The bill defines “sex” for the purposes of the education code and requires that instruction in human sexuality include instruction on the binary, stable, and unchanging nature of biological sex. The bill expands existing parental authority over a child’s education by extending the existing prohibition on inst ruction relating to sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through grade 3 to include prekindergarten through grade 8 and expressly stating that charter schools must comply with this requirement. Consistent with existing law, the bill requires that instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in grades 9 through 12 be age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students. Additionally, the bill requires additional transparency regarding school district policies and procedures. The bill implements new requirements relating to the use of personal titles and pronouns in Florida’s public schools, with an exception for individuals with specified conditions. The bill prohibits an employee, contractor, or student, as a condition of employment, enrollment, or participation, at a public K-12 educational institution, be required to refer to another individual by a personal title or pronouns that do not align with the person’s sex. Similarly, a K -12 public institution employee or contractor may not provide a student with the individuals preferred personal title or pronouns if they do not correspond to the employee or contactor’s sex. A school may not require a student to provide his or her preferred personal title or pronouns and may not apply any penalty or adverse action against a student for not providing this information.

Persons with the legal capacity to marry under current law may enter into a covenant marriage by declaring their intent on their marriage license application. The marriage license shall be designated as a covenant marriage license and shall be recorded as such and shall be considered valid and recognized by all governmental agencies, with all the benefits and rights of a standard marriage license. This act specifies the additional declarations and affidavits to be submitted by the parties to the covenant marriage and by the clergy or counselors who provided at least 8 hours of premarital counseling to the parties. Premarital counseling shall include: (1) a discussion of the seriousness of covenant marriage, (2) communication of the fact that covenant marriage is a commitment for life, (3) a discussion of the obligation to seek marital counseling in times of marital difficulties, and (4) a discussion of the limited grounds for legally terminating a covenant marriage by dissolution or legal separation. If a husband and wife have previously obtained a standard marriage license, they may convert that to a covenant marriage license by submitting a declaration and affidavit, as specified in the act. The husband and wife shall not be required to receive premarital counseling or have the converted covenant marriage solemnized. Additionally, this act establishes the requirements for terminating a covenant marriage. A husband or wife may file a petition in court for legal separation at any time, but a dissolution may only be granted after the court has first ordered a legal separation. The court shall order both parties to attend at least 40 hours of marital counseling prior to ordering a dissolution of marriage. This counseling may be provided by either a faith-based organization or a professional marriage counselor or agency. The court shall not enter a decree of dissolution until at least 2 years have passed after the initial filing for legal separation or dissolution and after first ordering a legal separation, for the following reasons: (1) adultery by either spouse; (2) habitual drug or alcohol abuse by either spouse; (3) a spouse has committed a felony and been sentenced to death or imprisonment; (4) a spouse has physically or sexually abused the other spouse, a child, a relative permanently living in the matrimonial domicile, or has committed domestic violence or severe emotional abuse; (5) a spouse has abandoned the matrimonial domicile and has not been in contact with the other spouse for at least 2 years; (6) the spouses have been living separately and continuously without reconciliation for at least 2 years; or (7) the husband and wife have both attended at least 40 hours of marital counseling over the course of at least 2 years.

The Bill requires the board of directors of a school district to notify the DE of any book that is removed from a school library because the book is deemed to contain obscene or sexually explicit material. The DE is required to maintain a list of such books, and school districts are prohibited from allowing a student to access a book on the list unless the school district has received prior written consent from the student’s parent or guardian. The Bill also provides for a number of curriculum changes, mostly to human growth and development curriculum. Specifically, the Bill prohibits any instruction by a school district, charter school, or innovation zone school regarding gender identity or human sexuality before grade five, or grade six if grade six is taught in elementary school. The Bill also removes language relating to certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In addition, the Bill requires students to pass the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services civics test as part of required United States government classes.

The Bill makes an exception for surveys required by State or federal law, but requires schools to provide seven days’ written notice to the student’s parent or guardian before administering such surveys. School districts are also prohibited from releasing information about students without receiving parental consent. The Bill asserts that a parent or guardian bears ultimate responsibility and has the constitutionally protected right to make decisions affecting their minor child, including decisions related to medical care, moral upbringing, religious upbringing, residence, education, and extracurricular activities. This bill requires a school district to notify a student’s parent or guardian if any employee reasonably believes that the student has expressed a gender identity that is different than the biological sex listed on the student’s birth certificate. If the school district is aware of specific threats to student safety that may occur as a result of such a disclosure, the school is not permitted to notify the parents, but is instead required to contact the Department of Health and Human Services. This bill permits the parent or guardian of a student to access and review any school record concerning the parent’s or guardian’s child unless the record is specifically prohibited from being disclosed. This bill prohibits school employees from referring to a student by a name or pronouns that do not correspond to the biological sex listed on the child’s birth certificate without explicit written consent from the student’s parent or guardian. This bill also prohibits school districts from requiring a student to engage in any activity or instruction provided by a guest lecturer or any activity or instruction that involves obscene or sexually explicit material without the explicit written consent of the student’s parent or guardian. Schools are required to provide notice of any such activity or instruction to parents or guardians at least seven days prior to the activity or instruction. Violations of these requirements carry penalties of a written warning for the first violation and a formal review by the Board of Educational Examiners for any subsequent violation. The bill also removes the requirement that students identified as requiring special education who wish to receive private competent instruction receive the permission of the local Area Education Agency (AEAs).

The Bill requires the board of directors of a school district to notify the DE of any book that is removed from a school library because the book is deemed to contain obscene or sexually explicit material. The DE is required to maintain a list of such books, and school districts are prohibited from allowing a student to access a book on the list unless the school district has received prior written consent from the student’s parent or guardian. The Bill also provides for a number of curriculum changes, mostly to human growth and development curriculum. Specifically, the Bill prohibits any instruction by a school district, charter school, or innovation zone school regarding gender identity or human sexuality before grade five, or grade six if grade six is taught in elementary school. The Bill also removes language relating to certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In addition, the Bill requires students to pass the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services civics test as part of required United States government classes. The Bill requires school districts, charter schools, and innovation zone schools to obtain prior written consent of a student’s parent or guardian before requiring a student to participate in any survey or formal assessment that is designed to assess a student’s mental, emotional, or physical health, or that would reveal information about the student or student’s parents, including information about political affiliations, mental or psychological problems, sexual behavior, illegal or antisocial behavior, religion, income, and more. The Bill makes an exception for surveys required by State or federal law, but requires schools to provide seven days’ written notice to the student’s parent or guardian before administering such surveys. School districts are also prohibited from releasing information about students without receiving parental consent. The Bill asserts that a parent or guardian bears ultimate responsibility and has the constitutionally protected right to make decisions affecting their minor child, including decisions related to medical care, moral upbringing, religious upbringing, residence, education, and extracurricular activities. This bill requires a school district to notify a student’s parent or guardian if any employee reasonably believes that the student has expressed a gender identity that is different than the biological sex listed on the student’s birth certificate. If the school district is aware of specific threats to student safety that may occur as a result of such a disclosure, the school is not permitted to notify the parents, but is instead required to contact the Department of Health and Human Services. This bill permits the parent or guardian of a student to access and review any school record concerning the parent’s or guardian’s child unless the record is specifically prohibited from being disclosed. This bill prohibits school employees from referring to a student by a name or pronouns that do not correspond to the biological sex listed on the child’s birth certificate without explicit written consent from the student’s parent or guardian. This bill also prohibits school districts from requiring a student to engage in any activity or instruction provided by a guest lecturer or any activity or instruction that involves obscene or sexually explicit material without the explicit written consent of the student’s parent or guardian. Schools are required to provide notice of any such activity or instruction to parents or guardians at least seven days prior to the activity or instruction. Violations of these requirements carry penalties of a written warning for the first violation and a formal review by the Board of Educational Examiners for any subsequent violation. The bill also removes the requirement that students identified as requiring special education who wish to receive private competent instruction receive the permission of the local Area Education Agency (AEAs).

The bill increases school district transparency and accountability for selecting and using instructional materials and library materials by requiring that district school boards be responsible for the contents of classroom libraries, in addition to instructional materials and school libraries. As part of fulfilling this responsibility, the bill requires that district school board policies regarding objections to specific materials include objection on the basis that the material depicts or describes sexual conduct, as defined in law. The bill provides for an exception to this objection for material used in required instruction on HIV/AIDS, child sexual abuse prevention, or any other course identified by the DOE. Any specific materials subject to an objection on the basis that the materials are pornographic, harmful to minors, or describe or depict sexual conduct must be removed from circulation at the school where the objection was made, within 5 days of the objection, until the completion of the objection process. Committees convened by a school district to review and make recommendations related to the adoption of instructional materials must include parents of students that will have access to the materials being reviewed. All meetings of such committees must be publicly noticed and open to the public. The bill creates an appeals process for a parent that disagrees with the school board’s determination on his or her objection. The DOE must adopt an objection form for use by school districts. The bill requires that all books in elementary school classroom libraries be included in the required online catalogue of elementary school library materials and school districts must adopt and implement a process for parents to limit their child’s access to library materials. The bill revises the annual reporting requirements regarding objections to materials. The bill requires the DOE to annually approve all instructional materials used to teach reproductive health and any disease, including HIV/AIDS. The bill defines “sex” for the purposes of the education code and requires that instruction in human sexuality include instruction on the binary, stable, and unchanging nature of biological sex. The bill expands existing parental authority over a child’s education by extending the existing prohibition on inst ruction relating to sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through grade 3 to include prekindergarten through grade 8 and expressly stating that charter schools must comply with this requirement. Consistent with existing law, the bill requires that instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in grades 9 through 12 be age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students. Additionally, the bill requires additional transparency regarding school district policies and procedures. The bill implements new requirements relating to the use of personal titles and pronouns in Florida’s public schools, with an exception for individuals with specified conditions. The bill prohibits an employee, contractor, or student, as a condition of employment, enrollment, or participation, at a public K-12 educational institution, be required to refer to another individual by a personal title or pronouns that do not align with the person’s sex. Similarly, a K -12 public institution employee or contractor may not provide a student with the individuals preferred personal title or pronouns if they do not correspond to the employee or contactor’s sex. A school may not require a student to provide his or her preferred personal title or pronouns and may not apply any penalty or adverse action against a student for not providing this information. The bill does not appear to have a fiscal impact.",FL HB1069

This act specifies the additional declarations and affidavits to be submitted by the parties to the covenant marriage and by the clergy or counselors who provided at least 8 hours of premarital counseling to the parties. Premarital counseling shall include: (1) a discussion of the seriousness of covenant marriage, (2) communication of the fact that covenant marriage is a commitment for life, (3) a discussion of the obligation to seek marital counseling in times of marital difficulties, and (4) a discussion of the limited grounds for legally terminating a covenant marriage by dissolution or legal separation. If a husband and wife have previously obtained a standard marriage license, they may convert that to a covenant marriage license by submitting a declaration and affidavit, as specified in the act. The husband and wife shall not be required to receive premarital counseling or have the converted covenant marriage solemnized. Additionally, this act establishes the requirements for terminating a covenant marriage. A husband or wife may file a petition in court for legal separation at any time, but a dissolution may only be granted after the court has first ordered a legal separation. The court shall order both parties to attend at least 40 hours of marital counseling prior to ordering a dissolution of marriage. This counseling may be provided by either a faith-based organization or a professional marriage counselor or agency. The court shall not enter a decree of dissolution until at least 2 years have passed after the initial filing for legal separation or dissolution and after first ordering a legal separation, for the following reasons: (1) adultery by either spouse; (2) habitual drug or alcohol abuse by either spouse; (3) a spouse has committed a felony and been sentenced to death or imprisonment; (4) a spouse has physically or sexually abused the other spouse, a child, a relative permanently living in the matrimonial domicile, or has committed domestic violence or severe emotional abuse; (5) a spouse has abandoned the matrimonial domicile and has not been in contact with the other spouse for at least 2 years; (6) the spouses have been living separately and continuously without reconciliation for at least 2 years; or (7) the husband and wife have both attended at least 40 hours of marital counseling over the course of at least 2 years.

Additionally, the bill updates the responsibilities of the Board of Governors (BOG) relating to the alignment of state university missions, including, providing direction to universities on the removal of majors and minors based on or using instruction from Critical Theory, or any derivative subject that engenders beliefs in divisive concepts. The bill bolsters the authority of University Boards of Trustees (UBOT) by permitting the review of a faculty member’s tenure status upon the request of the UBOT chair, but within parameters specified by BOG regulation. Consistent with its constitutional responsibilities, the bill requires each UBOT to select and hire faculty for the university, approve the university president’s selections for his or her executive management team, and prohibit solicitation of pledges or commitments to viewpoints related to DEI, CRT, or any political identity or ideology, as part any hiring, promotion, admission, disciplinary, promotion, or evaluation process.

The bill increases school district transparency and accountability for selecting and using instructional materials and library materials by requiring that district school boards be responsible for the contents of classroom libraries, in addition to instructional materials and school libraries. As part of fulfilling this responsibility, the bill requires that district school board policies regarding objections to specific materials include objection on the basis that the material depicts or describes sexual conduct, as defined in law. The bill provides for an exception to this objection for material used in required instruction on HIV/AIDS, child sexual abuse prevention, or any other course identified by the DOE. Any specific materials subject to an objection on the basis that the materials are pornographic, harmful to minors, or describe or depict sexual conduct must be removed from circulation at the school where the objection was made, within 5 days of the objection, until the completion of the objection process. Committees convened by a school district to review and make recommendations related to the adoption of instructional materials must include parents of students that will have access to the materials being reviewed. All meetings of such committees must be publicly noticed and open to the public. The bill creates an appeals process for a parent that disagrees with the school board’s determination on his or her objection. The DOE must adopt an objection form for use by school districts. The bill requires that all books in elementary school classroom libraries be included in the required online catalogue of elementary school library materials and school districts must adopt and implement a process for parents to limit their child’s access to library materials.

The bill expands existing parental authority over a child’s education by extending the existing prohibition on inst ruction relating to sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through grade 3 to include prekindergarten through grade 8 and expressly stating that charter schools must comply with this requirement. Consistent with existing law, the bill requires that instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in grades 9 through 12 be age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students.

Similarly, a K -12 public institution employee or contractor may not provide a student with the individuals preferred personal title or pronouns if they do not correspond to the employee or contactor’s sex.

Consistent with its constitutional responsibilities, the bill requires each UBOT to select and hire faculty for the university, approve the university president’s selections for his or her executive management team, and prohibit solicitation of pledges or commitments to viewpoints related to DEI, CRT, or any political identity or ideology, as part any hiring, promotion, admission, disciplinary, promotion, or evaluation process.
