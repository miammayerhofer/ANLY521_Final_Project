AK,Alaska,SB270,1,still need,"In the context of sexual indecency with a child, the bill criminalizes any adult knowingly entering and staying in changing facilities (restroom, bathroom, locker room, or shower room) when a minor of the opposite (biological) sex is also there, with a few exceptions for parents or emergencies. The bill can be interpreted as implicitly aimed at preventing transgender individuals from using changing facilities where minors are present too."
AK,Alaska,HB27,1,still need,"The bill amends an existing regulation of school sports by specifying biological sex as the decisive factor for the designation of athletic teams and competitions, requiring public and private schools to strictly split men, women, or coeducational teams and sports. In other words, the amendment excludes transgender students from participating in school sports and athletic competitions. The bill also provides an avenue for legal action against the school by those suffering harm from a violation of this law, i.e. in the case of admitting transgender students to sports and competitions."
AK,Alaska,HB1615,1,still need,The Conscience Protection Act limits the state government’s right to impose (the least severe) restrictions on a person’s exercise of religion only when it is essential for furthering a compelling government interest.

While it sets up a requirement to provide reasonable accommodation (e.g. single occupancy restroom or changing area) to any student unwilling or unable to follow this regulation, it explicitly prohibits providing access to facilities designated for the opposite biological sex. The bill imposes severe consequences for noncompliance."

AK,Alaska,SB199,1,still need,"This bill establishes healthcare professionals’ civil liability for performing a gender transition procedure on minors when it results in any physical, psychological, emotional, or physiological injury by the treatment. The bill requires a variety of strict conditions to be met for healthcare professionals to be exempt from legal liability, such as two continuous years of monitoring before any such procedure. The bill also provides a written consent form to be signed before treatments, citing studies from other countries on the perceived ineffectiveness and adverse impacts of gender transition treatments, incl. surgical procedures, puberty blockers, and cross-sex hormones. Medical procedures related to intersexual individuals, other verifiable chromosomal deviations as diagnosed by a physician, treatments of individuals in the case of conditions caused by prior gender transition procedure(s), and life-saving procedures are excluded. Gender transition procedure is defined broadly as all medical and surgical services as well as the prescription of drugs with the aim of changing physiological or anatomical characteristics that resemble a sex different from the individual's biological sex."

This bill also prohibits the government from discriminating against certain individuals and organizations because of their beliefs regarding marriage or what it means to be female and male. The bill additionally ensures that individuals and organizations cannot be compelled, either by the government or through a lawsuit initiated by a private party, to engage in conduct that conflicts with their beliefs, or be punished or discriminated against for declining to engage in conduct that conflicts with their beliefs.

The same applies for a woman or transgender man in a men's room with a male child present. Public changing facilities are defined as restrooms, locker or shower rooms but do not include a designated dressing area at a store where clothing is sold.

Any specific materials subject to an objection on the basis that the materials are pornographic, harmful to minors, or describe or depict sexual conduct must be removed from circulation at the school where the objection was made, within 5 days of the objection, until the completion of the objection process.
