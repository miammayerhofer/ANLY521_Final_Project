section tennessee code annotated title is amended by adding the following as new chapter findings the legislature declares that it must take action to protect the health and welfare of minors the legislature determines that medical procedures that alter minors hormonal balance remove minors sex organs or otherwise change minors physical appearance are harmful to minor when these medical procedures are performed for the purpose of enabling minor to identify with or live as purported identity inconsistent with the minors sex or treating purported discomfort or distress from disc or dance between the minors sex and asserted identity these procedures can lead to the minor becoming irreversibly sterile having increased risk of disease and illness or suffering from adverse and sometimes fatal psychological consequences moreover the legislature finds it likely that not all harmful effects associated with these types of medical procedures when performed on minor are yet fully known as many of these procedures when performed on minor for such purposes are experimental in nature and not supported by high quality long term medical studies the legislature determines that there is evidence that medical procedures that alter minors hormonal balance remove minors sex organs or otherwise change minors physical appearance are not consistent with professional medical standards when the medical procedures are performed for the purpose of enabling minor to identify with or live as purported identity inconsistent with the minors sex or treating purported discomfort or distress from disc or dance between the minors sex and asserted identity because minors disc or dance can be resolved by less invasive approaches that are likely to result in better outcomes for the minor the legislature finds that medical procedures are being performed on and administered to minors in this state for such purposes notwithstanding the risks and harms to the minors the legislature finds that dr john money one of the earliest advocates for performing or administering such medical procedures on minors and founder of the johns hopkins gender identity clinic abused minors entrusted to his care resulting in the suicides of david and brian rei mer the legislature finds that such medical procedures are being performed on and administered to minors in this state with rapidly increasing frequency and that supposed guidelines advocating such treatment have changed substantially in recent years the legislature finds that minors lack the maturity to fully understand and appreciate the life altering consequences of such procedures and that many individuals have expressed regret for medical procedures that were performed on or administered to them for such purposes when they were minors the legislature finds that many of the same pharmaceutical companies that contributed to the opioid epidemic have sought to profit from the administration of drugs to or use of devices on minors for such purposes and have paid consulting fees to physicians who then advocate for administration of drugs or use of devices for such purposes the legislature finds that healthcare providers in this state have sought to perform such surgeries on minors because the surgeries make lot of money and are huge moneymakers not necessarily because the surgeries are in minors best interest the legislature finds that healthcare providers in this state have threatened employees for conscientiously objecting for religious moral or ethical reasons to performing or administering such medical procedures the legislature finds that healthcare providers in this state have posted pictures of naked minors online to advertise such surgeries the legislature finds that planned parenthood of tennessee and north mississippian organization responsible for killing tens of thousands of unborn children has become one of the largest administrators in this state of such medical procedures the legislature declares that the integrity and public respect of the medical profession are significantly harmed by healthcare providers performing or administering such medical procedures on minors this

Specifically, the Bill prohibits any instruction by a school district, charter school, or innovation zone school regarding gender identity or human sexuality before grade five, or grade six if grade six is taught in elementary school. The Bill also removes language relating to certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In addition, the Bill requires students to pass the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services civics test as part of required United States government classes. The Bill requires school districts, charter schools, and innovation zone schools to obtain prior written consent of a student’s parent or guardian before requiring a student to participate in any survey or formal assessment that is designed to assess a student’s mental, emotional, or physical health, or that would reveal information about the student or student’s parents, including information about political affiliations, mental or psychological problems, sexual behavior, illegal or antisocial behavior, religion, income, and more. The Bill makes an exception for surveys required by State or federal law, but requires schools to provide seven days’ written notice to the student’s parent or guardian before administering such surveys. School districts are also prohibited from releasing information about students without receiving parental consent. The Bill asserts that a parent or guardian bears ultimate responsibility and has the constitutionally protected right to make decisions affecting their minor child, including decisions related to medical care, moral upbringing, religious upbringing, residence, education, and extracurricular activities. This bill requires a school district to notify a student’s parent or guardian if any employee reasonably believes that the student has expressed a gender identity that is different than the biological sex listed on the student’s birth certificate. If the school district is aware of specific threats to student safety that may occur as a result of such a disclosure, the school is not permitted to notify the parents, but is instead required to contact the Department of Health and Human Services. This bill permits the parent or guardian of a student to access and review any school record concerning the parent’s or guardian’s child unless the record is specifically prohibited from being disclosed. This bill prohibits school employees from referring to a student by a name or pronouns that do not correspond to the biological sex listed on the child’s birth certificate without explicit written consent from the student’s parent or guardian. This bill also prohibits school districts from requiring a student to engage in any activity or instruction provided by a guest lecturer or any activity or instruction that involves obscene or sexually explicit material without the explicit written consent of the student’s parent or guardian. Schools are required to provide notice of any such activity or instruction to parents or guardians at least seven days prior to the activity or instruction. Violations of these requirements carry penalties of a written warning for the first violation and a formal review by the Board of Educational Examiners for any subsequent violation. The bill also removes the requirement that students identified as requiring special education who wish to receive private competent instruction receive the permission of the local Area Education Agency (AEAs). This bill allows the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of a student identified as requiring special education to request dual enrollment.",IA SF496,test,tl s jd section section code is amended by adding the following new subsection new subsection adopt rules that require school districts and charter schools to periodically review the materials currently available in libraries . the department shall update the comprehensive list at least once each month sec section subsections and code are amended to read as follows the kindergarten programs hall include experiences designed to develop healthy emotional and social habits and growth in the language arts and communication skills as well as capacity for the completion of individual tasks .,0.10357142857142858,0.42028985507246375,0.16618910857546332,0.020599250936329586,0.125,0.03536977249035903,0.1,0.4057971014492754,0.16045844954967536
